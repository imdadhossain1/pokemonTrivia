<h1> Project Title: Pokemon Trivia </h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

Pokemon is a Japanese media franhise founded by Nintendo and is centered on fictional creatures called Pokemon. In Pokemon humans, known as Pokemon Trainers, catch and train Pokemon to battle other Pokemon for sport and glory.

Trivia is a type of game in which players (who can play individually or in a team) are asked questions about different topics and they have to get as many correct answers as possible. 

My Project will ask the user various trivia questions on Pokemon and feature a High Scores leaderboard.
