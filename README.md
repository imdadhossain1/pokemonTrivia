<h1> Project Title: Pokemon Trivia </h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

Pokemon is a Japanese media franchise founded by Nintendo and is centered on fictional creatures called Pokemon. In Pokemon humans, known as Pokemon Trainers, catch and train Pokemon to battle other Pokemon for sport and glory.

Trivia is a type of game in which players (who can play individually or in a team) are asked questions about different topics and they have to get as many correct answers as possible. 

My Project will ask the user various trivia questions on Pokemon and feature a High Scores leaderboard.


<h3>How to Get Started:</h3>

Press play on the homepage to start the trivia game. The questions will be presented in a random order. The progress bar will fill up as you answer each question and you will receive 100 points for each correct answer. If the answer you clicked is correct, your selected choice will flash green - if you answer incorrectly, your selected choice will flash red. At the end of the game you will be given the option to save your High Score when you enter your name. If you do not enter a name, the option to save will be disabled. Once you save your high score you will be taken back to the home page where you will click on the High Scores button to access the leaderboard.
